# iland-book
The iLand "book" - is an extensive documentation ressource on using iLand. It contains  twelve chapters and on >140 pages and has two main parts:

The first part (Part I) is about getting to know iLand and is a guide  through the first steps of using the model. The second part (Part II) covers a number of advanced topics that may or may not be immediately relevant. The material covers technical aspects of using the model (for example, advanced JavaScript, running of simulation experiments locally and on compute clusters), and also advanced tasks in applying the model (such as parameterization of species, calibration and evaluation, and setting up new landscapes).

The book is available:

## How to "build"
The best way to build your own copy of the book is to use RStudio. 
* open the project `book.Rproj` (located in the the main folder) with RStudio
* open any chapter (`xxxx.qmd`) 
* click on "Render" to create HTML files (as for the online version), or click "Render PDF" to create a single PDF document.
