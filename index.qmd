# Preface

This is a book about iLand - iLand is a model of forest landscape dynamics, simulating individual tree competition, growth, mortality, and regeneration. It addresses interactions between climate (change), disturbance regimes, vegetation dynamics, and forest management.

## Who is the audience of this book

## Content of the book

The book consists of two parts:

The first part (**Part I**) is about getting to know iLand and guides you through the first steps of using the model. The second part (**Part II**) covers a number of advanced topics that may or may not be immediately relevant for you.

## Planned content of the book

**Part I -- Getting to know iLand**

1.   Why iLand?

rationale and background of developing iLand, for which questions iLand is designed for, \...

2.   Getting started

Getting and installing iLand, first steps, running example landscape, where to find information and help?

3.  Working with iLand[\[p1\]](#_msocom_1) 

3.1.General concepts

Project folders, settings and project file, input data, data formats, „landscape"

3.2.Tour of the UI

3.3. Running simulations

(basically content of lecture)

3.3.1.  Scenarios

(climate change, disturbances)

4.   iLand inputs

4.1.Spatial layout

4.2.Climate data

4.3.Soil data

4.4.Initial vegetation

5.   iLand outputs

General strategy

R code, links

6.   Model components

High level overview over the parts of iLand that can be used, switched on / off etc. Mostly a pointer to wiki / advanced chapters.

Permafrost, Microclimate, Browsing, Ground vegetation, Disturbance modules, forest management, Carbon cycle, Nitrogen cycle, Grass(??)

**Part II -- Advanced topics**

7.   Scripting

7.1.Integration in iLand[\[p2\]](#_msocom_2)  / user interface

7.2.iLand objects, variables, expressions, Javascript APIs

7.3.Typical use cases

7.3.1.   Automation tasks

7.3.2.   Management

7.3.3.   Mimicking stuff (e.g. disturbances)

7.3.4.   Outputs

7.4.Best practices for editing and debugging scripts

7.5.A gentle primer to Javascript (to help understand object/code mix a la Bite, ABE)

Specifically: explain expression, JS objects

Object creation (

7.6.Examples

Spatial data, management

User defined disturbance agents, etc

Reading / writing data, processing external inputs

8.   Setting up landscapes

8.1.Biophysical landscape

7.1.1. Landscape size and boundaries

8.2.Climate

7.2.1. Downscaling climate data

8.3.vegetation

8.3.1.     Spinup

8.3.2.    External seed input

8.3.3.   Delineating stands

8.3.4.   Initializing with forest inventory data

8.4.        Disturbances

8.5.   Management

9.   Species parameterization and calibration

  Literature parameters, TRY database\
 Iterative parameters (aging, sap reference ratio, etc.)\
 Calibration runs/experiments\
 Sensitivity analysis (i.e., which parameters to focus on during calibration process)

10.    Evaluation of simulation results

   Species-level evaluations (single species productivity, regeneration, mortality; mixed species)\
  Landscape-level evaluations (PNV, stand structure)\
  Evaluating updates to parameters with PETS

11.    Managing simulation experiments

Command line parameters[\[p3\]](#_msocom_3) 

Running multiple scenarios, replicates, different input files

Pre-processing outputs (e.g., with R script)

Running on a cluster

12.    Extending iLand

Working with iLand code, Qt, etc\
SVD????

13.    Problem solving / Extras[\[p4\]](#_msocom_4) 

Debug outputs\
Advanced GUI\
\

Add an overview of the project file somewhere in here, maybe in "General concepts" or "Running simulations"

Include GUI integration here

Assuming this is referring to updating lines in the project file?

Idea here is to include tips & tricks for identifying, diagnosing, and solving problems that may arise. TBD if makes sense to include here.
